# Netflix_frontend

Netflix Clone Project
This repository contains the source code for a web application inspired by Netflix, built during my virtual internship at Bharat Intern.

Features:

Simulates a Netflix-like experience: Browse through a list of movies, view details, and explore different categories.
Utilizes front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a structured, styled, and interactive user interface.
Incorporates API calls: Simulates fetching movie data from an external source (TMDB api used).

Contribution:

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your improvements!

Disclaimer:

This project is for educational purposes only and does not implement full functionality of a real Netflix application.
